# Project Plan – Portfolio v2

## Vision
This portfolio is more than a static showcase — it is a living demonstration of my engineering approach.  
It combines clarity (clean design, accessible-first), interactivity (skills and projects you can use on-site), and transparency (repo shows behind-the-scenes product thinking).  

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 – Foundations
- Repo setup & environment
- CI/CD + linting/testing
- Staging environment
- Accessibility baseline

### Phase 2 – Core Content
- About / Skills / Work Experience
- Interactive portfolio projects (in-site demos)
- Contact (email-first, no phone)

### Phase 3 – Data/SQL Showcase
- Data collection (5 playful prompts)
- SQL backend demo: buttons triggering queries
- Visualization of results

### Phase 4 – Extras
- Easter eggs (hover effects, hidden jokes, dev treats)
- Changelog + ticket system visible

### Phase 5 – Polish
- Final accessibility pass (Lighthouse score 95+)
- Neutral color scheme with subtle branding
- Repo tidy + release notes

## Workflow
- 5 tickets per week (1 per workday)  
- Changelog updated alongside commits  
- Each phase logged with clear completion markers

This document is living. Scope may flex, but transparency will remain.
