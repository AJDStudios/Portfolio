# Project Plan

## Vision

Show senior-level practice through a lean site: accessible UI, data handling,
and transparent repo process (issues, changelog, releases). Treat this repo as
a reusable template baseline for future projects.

## Phases (high-level)

1. **Foundations**: repo, CI, envs, a11y baseline, secrets hygiene [x]
2. **Core site skeleton**: routes, tokens, content []
3. **Data feature**: 5 Qs + SQL demo explorer []
4. **Mini-projects**: 2 inline demos (MVP), 3rd later []
5. **Polish**: docs, a11y/Lighthouse, easter eggs []

## Working cadence

* \~5 issues/week (1 per weekday)
* **CHANGELOG and docs updated after each 5-issue sprint** (including README and PLAN)
* Protected `main`, PRs only; CI (lint, tests, build) required to merge
* Project board used for visibility: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
* Templates (issues, PRs) and SECURITY/PRIVACY policies baked in from week 1
