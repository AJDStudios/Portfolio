# Project Plan

## Vision

Show senior-level practice through a lean site: accessible UI, data handling,
and transparent repo process (issues, changelog, releases).

## Phases (high-level)

1. Foundations: repo, CI, envs, a11y baseline
2. Core site skeleton: routes, tokens, content placeholders
3. Data feature: 5 Qs + SQL demo explorer
4. Mini-projects: 2 inline demos (MVP), 3rd later
5. Polish: docs, a11y/Lighthouse, easter eggs

## Working cadence

- ~5 issues/week (1 per weekday)
- CHANGELOG entries per milestone
- Protected `main`, PRs only
