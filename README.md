# Aaron’s Portfolio (v2)

This repo is the home of my new developer portfolio site.  
The goal is not just to showcase projects, but to demonstrate **product thinking, data handling, and end-to-end engineering practice** — from initial planning to production-ready features.

### Current Status

- **Week 1 (Issues #1–6)**: Foundations in place: repo scaffold, CI, Postgres via Docker, initial web/app setup, templates, and policies.
- See [PROJECT_PLAN.md](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) for roadmap and cadence.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for milestone history.

### Key Features (Planned)

- Clean React (Vite) + Node stack
- Interactive About + Skills (mini-projects)
- Data collection section with playful prompts
- SQL demo + visualization (pgAdmin-ready)
- Accessible-first design (Lighthouse tested)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD, Dependabot, branch protection
- Easter eggs for devs

### Contributing & Policies

- Issue and PR templates live under `.github/`
- SECURITY and PRIVACY policies included; no secrets committed
- Project board visible [here](link to board)

This repo is public by design — part of the demonstration is the _process itself_.
