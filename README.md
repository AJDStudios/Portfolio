# Aaron’s Portfolio (v2)

This repo is the home of my new developer portfolio site.  
The goal is not just to showcase projects, but to demonstrate product thinking, data handling, and end-to-end engineering practice.

### Current Status

- **Day 0**: Repository created. Planning phase underway.
- See [PROJECT_PLAN.md](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) for roadmap and tickets.

### Key Features (Planned)

- Clean React/Node/Django stack
- Interactive About + Skills (mini-projects)
- Data collection section with playful prompts
- SQL demo + visualization
- Accessible-first design (Lighthouse tested)
- Easter eggs for devs

---

This repo is public by design — part of the demonstration is the _process itself_.
